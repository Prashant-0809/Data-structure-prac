# DATA STRUCTURE SEM III
THIS IS A REPO ABOUT THE PRACTICALS GIVEN TO THE STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF DELHI UNDER NEP.

## CONTENT OF THE REPO
1. Write a program to implement a singly linked list as an ADT that supports the following 
operations:
* `Insert an element x at the beginning` of the singly linked list
* `Insert an element x at ith position` in the singly linked list
* `Remove an element from the beginning`of the singly linked list
* `Remove an element from ith position` in the singly link
* `Search for an element x`in the singly linked list and return its pointer
* `Concatenate two singly linked lists`

2. Write a program to implement doubly linked list as an ADT that supports the following 
operations:
* `Insert an element x at the beginning` of the doubly linked list
* `Insert an element x at ith` position in the doubly linked list
* `Insert an element x at the end` of the doubly linked list
* `Remove an element from the beginning` of the doubly linked list
* `Remove an element from ith position` in the doubly linked list.
* `Remove an element from the end` of the doubly linked list
* `Search for an element x` in the doubly linked list and return its pointer
* `Concatenate two doubly linked lists`

3. Write a program to implement circular linked list as an ADT which supports the 
following operations:
* Insert an element x at the front of the circularly linked list
* Insert an element x after an element y in the circularly linked list
* Insert an element x at the back of the circularly linked list
* Remove an element from the back of the circularly linked list
* Remove an element from the front of the circularly linked list
* Remove the element x from the circularly linked list
* Search for an element x in the circularly linked list and return its pointer
* Concatenate two circularly linked lists

4. Implement a stack as an ADT using Arrays.

5. Implement a stack as an ADT using the Linked List ADT

6. Write a program to evaluate a prefix/postfix expression using stacks

7. Implement Queue as an ADT using the circular Arrays.

8. Implement Queue as an ADT using the Circular Linked List ADT

9. Write a program to implement Binary Search Tree as an ADT which supports the 
following operations:
* Insert an element x
* Delete an element x
* Search for an element x in the BST and change its value to y and then place the node with value y at its appropriate position in the BST
* Display the elements of the BST in preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal
* Display the elements of the BST in level-by-level traversal
* Display the height of the BST

10. Write a program to implement a balanced search tree as an ADT
